Part I: Planning & Design (15 pts)

* Decide on a game idea and core goal
* Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out
* Main objects (player, obstacles, goals, enemies, etc.) are identified
* Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step

Game Idea:
*Pong clone

Game Rules:
* Use the up and down arrow keys, W and S.

Major Game Elements:
* Pong bars, ball, score, and the border. The bot.

Gameplay Process:
* When player uses W and S. It moves their bar up and down to hit the ball to their opponent. Additionally we need a pong bot that can do the same actions as the player.
I.E moving it up and down. The ball needs to be able to bounce off of the bars and have code to add to the points when it crosses the other team's side and is hit.
Make it bigger. Maybe 21 by 14 with a 1 by 3 paddle and a 1 by 1 ball
